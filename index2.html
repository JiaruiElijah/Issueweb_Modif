		<span>Cyber violence is difficult to define, let alone 
systematically track. As a result, prevalence 
rates are largely unknown. There have been 
a number of large-scale, national surveys of 
youth that examine cyber bullying and cyber 
dating violence. </span>

		<h1>Around the World</h1>
		<p>For example, one study used 
a large national telephone survey (N = 4561) of 
youth ages 10–17 during 2000, 2005, and 2010 
(Jones, Mitchell, & Finkelhor, 2013). The rate of
online harassment nearly doubled in a decade, 
from 6% in 2000 to 11% in 2010. Girls made up
69% of victims, an increase from 2000, and were 
more likely to report the incident occurred on a 
social networking site like Facebook. </p>

	<div class="tet2">	
		<p>The 
reported rates of cyber-bullying in another 
national survey of 1588 youth ages 10–15 in 2008 
were much higher (Ybarra, Mitchell, & Korchmaros, 
2011). This study used a national, online survey of 
randomly selected households. In the last wave of 
this study, nearly 40% of the sample reported 
being victimized at some point and nearly 25% of 
the sample reported perpetrating harassment online.</p>
