		<h2>1. Stop being agressive on the Internet </h2>
		<span>Nowadays, people spend a lot of time online every day. 
Whether it's on a social website or a video website, 
if you feel angry because you don't have the same 
opinion as someone else, refrain from making your words 
seem personally offensive.</span>
		<h2>2. Recongnize the cyberbulling.</h2>
		<span>When the bullying takes place online, it can result in unwanted 
attention from a wide range of people including strangers. Wherever it may happen, 
if you are not happy about it, you should not have to stand for it.</span>

		<h2>3. Report.</h2>
		<span>If the bullying is happening on a social platform, consider blocking the bully 
and formally reporting their behaviour on the platform itself. Social media companies 
are obligated to keep their users safe.It can be helpful to collect evidence – text 
messages and screen shots of social media posts – to show what’s been going on.
For bullying to stop, it needs to be identified and reporting it is key. It can also help 
to show the bully that their behaviour is unacceptable.If you are in immediate danger, 
then you should contact the police or emergency services in your country.</span>
